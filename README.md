# CTA3 2024 - CS1 International Tax Practice Case Study

# Background Summary:
SkyNet Ltd a UK-based company is expanding operations into Australia including establishing a manufacturing facility in Blacktown NSW to produce quantum computing chips and setting up sales offices in major Australian cities. The project will cost A$100m financed through a combination of external borrowing and internal funds. SkyNet will also pay royalties to an Australian university for research utilized in chip manufacturing. The chips produced will be exported to the UK where SkyNet will integrate them into quantum computers for global sales including Australia. SkyNet does not plan to incorporate an Australian subsidiary but may consider selling its Australian business in the future.

Late Breaking Fact:
Additional information reveals that SkyNet is now planning to build the chip manufacturing facility in Singapore instead of Australia using Australia as a base for sales into Asia. SkyNet intends to incorporate an Australian company AustCo and fund the Singaporean facility through loans from RB channeled through AustCo which may directly or indirectly (via SgCo) construct the facility.

Questions:
1. Permanent Establishment (PE) in Australia: Does SkyNet have one or more PEs in Australia and if so why?
2. Income Attributable to PE: What income or profits might be attributable to any PE in Australia?
3. Expense Treatment: How would expenses incurred by the Australian operations be treated for Australian income tax purposes?
4. Repatriation of Funds: How would funds repatriated from the Australian operations to the UK on an annual basis be treated for Australian income tax purposes?
5. Other Australian Tax Impacts: What other Australian tax impacts including treaty/Multilateral Instrument (MLI) provisions (excluding GST and other indirect taxes) are relevant?
6. Taxation of Sale Proceeds: How would any sale proceeds from an exit by selling the Australian business be taxed in Australia?

Code of Professional Conduct Issues:
1. Compliance with Tax Agent Services Act 2009 (Cth): What specific issues does this scenario present for the adviser under the Tax Agent Services Act 2009?
2. Consequences of Non-Compliance: What are the potential consequences for the adviser failing to observe the provisions of the Act and which are likely to apply in this case?

Suggested Solutions:
1. International Tax Considerations:
   - The Australia-UK bilateral tax treaty influenced by the OECD Multilateral Instrument (MLI) applies to SkyNet. For a PE to exist in Australia it must have geographical and temporal permanence. SkyNet's leased sales offices and manufacturing facility in Australia likely constitute a PE under Article 5 of the Australia-UK treaty. Activities such as manufacturing and negotiating contracts in Australia are central to SkyNet’s business making them taxable in Australia.
2. Australian Income Tax Treatment:
   - SkyNet as a non-resident is taxed on Australian-sourced income. Profits from sales to Australian customers and from the export of computer chips are assessable in Australia. Deductions for staff costs rent and office administration are allowed under Australian tax law. Notional charges between head office and branch are not deductible but actual interest paid for factory construction may be deductible.
3. Other Australian Tax Impacts:
   - Eligible interest deductions are subject to debt creation and thin capitalization rules. New debt deduction creation rules (effective 1 July 2024) disallow deductions lacking commercial justification. Revised thin capitalization rules (effective 1 July 2023) introduce earnings-based tests particularly the Fixed Ratio Test (FRT) which allows net debt deductions up to 30% of tax EBITDA. Ensuring compliance with transfer pricing rules is critical in navigating these regulations.
4. Late Breaking Fact - Tax Issues:
   - Incorporation in Singapore: Direct construction by AustCo in Singapore would create a PE there making the income taxable in Singapore and treated as NANE income in Australia. If SgCo is incorporated it will be a CFC for Australian tax purposes but would not be attributable due to the substantial manufacture test.
   - Capitalization (Debt vs. Equity): Equity investment would generate NANE income in the form of dividends while debt investment would generate assessable interest income requiring careful consideration of debt-equity characterization interest deductibility and thin capitalization rules.
   - Interest-Free Loan to SgCo: An interest-free loan from AustCo to SgCo may pose risks related to transfer pricing and anti-avoidance provisions if AustCo cannot derive assessable income to deduct interest outgoings.
5. Personal Tax Implications for Alex:
   - Alex's move to Australia will make her an Australian resident for tax purposes taxable on worldwide income unless she qualifies as a temporary resident. She may face CGT on non-TAP assets deemed acquired at market value upon becoming a resident. Alex's residency could affect the CMC of SkyNet making it an Australian CFC and subject to the attributable taxpayer rules. The treatment of dividends from SkyNet will depend on whether the active income test is satisfied.
6. Transfer Pricing Concerns:
   - Method Selection: Evaluating the appropriateness of the TP method (CUP RPM or TNMM) is crucial considering functional and risk profiles. CUP may be suitable but RPM or TNMM could be more appropriate if reliable comparables are lacking.
   - Documentation Requirements: Thorough documentation including functional analysis and economic analysis is essential to mitigate TP risks particularly in light of BEPS and Australian TP documentation requirements.
   - Potential TP Adjustments: The ATO may scrutinize TP adjustments especially under BEPS and MAAL with implications for penalties interest and reputational damage.
7. Residency and International Tax Issues:
   - Residency Status: Emily's move to Australia will make her an Australian resident for tax purposes liable for tax on worldwide income unless she qualifies as a temporary resident.
   - UK Property and Income: Rental income from UK property will be taxed in the UK and Australia with a FITO available to avoid double taxation. Emily's UK property will be classified as TAP subjecting any capital gains on its disposal to Australian CGT with potential UK CGT liabilities depending on her residency period and DTA operation. 

In conclusion SkyNet must navigate a complex international tax landscape ensuring compliance with both Australian and international tax laws while planning for the potential relocation of its manufacturing facility to Singapore. Transfer pricing residency issues and personal tax implications for key individuals like Alex require careful consideration to optimize tax outcomes and mitigate risks.
